    JavaScript in <body>...</body> section
If you need a script to run as the page loads so that the script generates content in the page, then the script goes in the <body> portion of the document. 
    In this case, you would not have any function defined using JavaScript. Take a look at the following code.

-->

<html>
   <head>
   </head>
   
   <body>
      <script type = "text/javascript">

            document.write("Hello World")

      </script>
      
      <p>This is web page body </p>
   </body>
</html>
