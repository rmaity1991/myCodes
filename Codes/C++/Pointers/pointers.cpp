/*
Creation of Pointers and Usage

A pointer is a variable that represents the location (rather than
the value) of a data item.
• They have a number of useful applications.
– Enables us to access a variable that is defined outside the
function.
– Can be used to pass information back and forth between a
function and its reference point.
– More efficient in handling data tables.
– Reduces the length and complexity of a program.
– Sometimes also increases the execution speed.

In memory, every stored data item occupies one or more
contiguous memory cells.
– The number of memory cells required to store a data item
depends on its type (char, int, double, etc.).
• Whenever we declare a variable, the system allocates
memory location(s) to hold the value of the variable.
– Since every byte in memory has a unique address, this
location will also have its own (unique) address.

Since memory addresses are simply numbers, they can be
assigned to some variables which can be stored in
memory.
– Such variables that hold memory addresses are called
pointers.
– Since a pointer is a variable, its value is also stored in
some memory location.
