<!--
    A property called visibility allows you to hide an element from view. You can use this property along with 
    JavaScript to create very complex menu and very complex webpage layouts.

You may choose to use the visibility property to hide error messages that are only displayed if the user needs 
to see them, or to hide answers to a quiz until the user selects an option.
