<!--
    The table-layout Property
The table-layout property is supposed to help you control how a browser should render or lay out a table.

This property can have one of the three values: fixed, auto or inherit.

The following example shows the difference between these properties.

NOTE âˆ’ This property is not supported by many browsers so do not rely on this property.

         table.fixed {
            table-layout: fixed
         }
      </style>
