/*
C# Destructors
A destructor is a special member function of a class that is executed whenever an object of its class goes out of scope. 
A destructor has exactly the same name as that of the class with a prefixed tilde (~) and it can neither return a value nor 
can it take any parameters.

Destructor can be very useful for releasing memory resources before exiting the program. Destructors cannot be inherited 
or overloaded.
