/*
C# - Interfaces
An interface is defined as a syntactical contract that all the classes inheriting the interface should follow. 
The interface defines the 'what' part of the syntactical contract and the deriving classes define the 'how' part 
of the syntactical contract.

Interfaces define properties, methods, and events, which are the members of the interface. Interfaces contain only 
the declaration of the members. It is the responsibility of the deriving class to define the members. It often helps 
in providing a standard structure that the deriving classes would follow.

Abstract classes to some extent serve the same purpose, however, they are mostly used when only few methods are to be 
declared by the base class and the deriving class implements the functionalities.
