/*
Dynamic Polymorphism
C# allows you to create abstract classes that are used to provide partial class implementation of an interface. 
Implementation is completed when a derived class inherits from it. Abstract classes contain abstract methods, which 
are implemented by the derived class. The derived classes have more specialized functionality.

Here are the rules about abstract classes −

You cannot create an instance of an abstract class

You cannot declare an abstract method outside an abstract class

When a class is declared sealed, it cannot be inherited, abstract classes cannot be declared sealed.
