<!--
    The general concept of events in XAML is similar to events in other popular programming languages such as .NET and 
    C++. In XAML, all of the controls expose some events so that they can be subscribed for specific purposes.

Whenever an event takes place, the application will be notified and the program can react to them, e.g., close buttons 
are used to close a dialog.

There are many types of events that can be subscribed for different behaviors of an application based on the requirement 
of that application, but the most commonly used events are those which are related to mouse and keyboard such as,

Click
MouseDown
MouseEnter
MouseLeave
MouseUp
KeyDown
KeyUp
