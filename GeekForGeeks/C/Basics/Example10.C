/*
Some data types like char , short int take less number of bytes than int, these data types are automatically promoted 
to int or unsigned int when an operation is performed on them. This is called integer promotion. For example no 
arithmetic calculation happens on smaller types like char, short and enum. They are first converted to int or unsigned 
int, and then arithmetic is done on them. If an int can represent all values of the original type, the value is 
converted to an int . Otherwise, it is converted to an unsigned int.

    At first look, the expression (a*b)/c seems to cause arithmetic overflow because signed characters 
    can have values only from -128 to 127 (in most of the C compilers), and the value of subexpression ‘(a*b)’ is 1200 
    which is greater than 128. But integer promotion happens here in arithmetic done on char types and we get the 
    appropriate result without any overflow.
